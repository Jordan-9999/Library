# Library

This is a Library app project that I made for the Odin Project course using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I was able to get a little experience working with object constructors and
making prototype functions.
You can submit a book's title & author to the library, and there are buttons
to toggle whether it's been read or not or to delete it from the library.

Here is a link to the library project lesson that I was following:

Thank you for taking the time to look at my project. -Jordan Sheeler
